				I'm attracted to people who know how to experience joy and wonder. Safe people create an environment of trust. My goal with every encounter is to let people know that they are safe with me so I can break down any walls from any reservations. 
				<br /><br />
I believe documenting is important, we must take record of important events. But I'm more interested in helping you create memories. There are times when I'm your own personal ninja and then there are times when I'm having a dance off with one of the groomsmen.
